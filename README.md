# static-analysis-demo README

If you don't want users to directly attach methods to objects, but instead attach and use methods through `setMethod` / `getMethod`, you can use this plugin.
This plugin is designed to help coders better track `string function names`, and provide input hints for function signatures and function name completion.

**Enjoy!**
